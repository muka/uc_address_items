# uc_address_items

Adds some additional fields to Ubercart address in Drupal 7
Those fields can be extended by editing the *.install file in the hook_schema() adding more field or toggling unused.
The base fields are some useful in Italy
 * `Partita Iva`
 * `Codice Fiscale`
 * `IBAN`

A day, all this could be handled within Entity API and made fieldable (after a stable release will be out).
